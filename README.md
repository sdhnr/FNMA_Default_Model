# FNMA_Default_Model

## Overview

This repository houses a completed Data Science project focusing on economic analysis, incorporating data from Fannie Mae and FRED (Federal Reserve Economic Data) among other sources. The project involved:

1. **Data Preparation**: Utilized AWS Athena queries and S3 bucket to prepare and downsample the initial dataset.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Conducted thorough EDA on the downsampled dataset to extract insights and understand the data better.

3. **Additional Data Integration**:
    - Integrated FRED data, sourced from the Federal Reserve Economic Data, to supplement the Fannie Mae mortgage data.
    - Merged state and county data obtained from a GitHub repository to enrich the analysis.
    - Incorporated state, county, city, and zip code information from HUD USER to enhance unemployment data for detailed analysis.

## Usage
 **Analysis**: Explore the EDA and analysis conducted in [Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/sdhnr/FNMA_Default_Model/tree/main) in the  directory.

## Next Steps
The project data is cleaned, combined, and primed for advanced analysis, modeling, or specific data science tasks. Feel free to fork this repository to continue and expand the analysis as required.
